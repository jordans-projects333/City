        <p>Our highly trained stylists are here to tackle all of your needs, with the highest quality colouring that will leave you looking and feeling your best. Before a colouring service, we politely request that you pop in for a skin test. This will need to be done 48 hours prior to your appointment. Alternatively, you can sign a disclaimer to say you agree to your colour service without a skin test. This will only be needed for your first appoinment with us.</p>
